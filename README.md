Business Analyst Case
Instructions
Read the task below carefully. Please submit the case study 24 hours before your
interview, via email. You can reach out to your JET* contact if you have any questions.
Brief context
JET is a well known food-delivery company in Austria. We connect partners
(restaurants, grocery stores, retail businesses) with consumers, with the ambition to
deliver everyday convenience to our customers.
We have two types of operating models:
●Marketplace: The partner delivers the order themselves. JET acts as a
marketplace, where the customer places the order through our app or website.
We receive a commission for the order.
Logistics/Delivery: The order is placed through JET, but we also complete the
delivery ourselves through our Delco Logistics business. We receive higher
commission, but incur delivery costs.
Task
Please create a dummy, strawman-level trading deck for a weekly trading meeting, you
would conduct at JET. Please use the information you find relevant from the dataset to
tell a compelling story to a potential audience composed of:
●
●
●
●
Marketing,
Sales,
Logistics
Finance
Furthermore, let’s hypothetically consider we are trading below our targets. Walk us
through a list of initiatives (in Marketing, Sales and Logistics; at least one of each) we
can deploy to improve our order volume trend in the short term.
